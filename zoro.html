               one piece is an anime that talks about the world politics and human trafficking and racisim and much more. <br> Its the pinacle of creativity. <br> Its not just some show about a pirate guy who want to become the king of the pirates
               it says more than that. <br> it has a lot of hidden mysteries and hidden meanings.
               <br> Its an anime that shows what real freedom looks like.
